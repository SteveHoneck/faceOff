# faceOff
Browser-based game, find the extra face!
Created after a four week Nucamp Bootcamp course on web fundamentals of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Buttons, notifications, and animations guide the user through a game of finding the extra face. DOM manipulation logic was part of the bootcamp culminating exercise while additional features were added as part of personal exploration.

Knowing what I know now, there is a lot I would change around in the project. However, it is a snapshot in time of what I was doing after four weeks of learning!
