# faceOff
Browser-based game, find the extra face!

[![](./Images/Screenshot.png?raw=true "Click to play!")](https://faceoff.stevehoneck.com)

Created after a four week Nucamp Bootcamp course on web fundamentals of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Buttons, notifications, and animations guide the user through a game of finding the extra face. DOM manipulation logic was part of the bootcamp culminating exercise while additional features were added as part of personal exploration.


Future updates:
- Endgame / Leader board
- Optimize for mobile
