# faceOff
Browser-based game, find the missing faces!
Created after a four week Nucamp Bootcamp course on web fundamentals of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Basic buttons, notifications, and animations guide the user through a game of finding missing faces. Initial DOM manipulation logic was part of the bootcamp culminating exercise while additional features were added as part of personal exploration.

Knowing what I know now, there is a lot I would change around in the project. However, it is a snapshot in time of what I was doing after four weeks of learning!

V1: Base version.\
V2: Added extra functions: Let user pick difficulty, track number of rounds, let user restart game\
V3: Make difficulty select a 3 button choice\
V4: Make game over only on click on wrong face instead of anywhere but correct face\
V5: Add random Face generation using an array\
V6: Make noise and face grow when click on the correct face, make correct face grow when click on the wrong face\
V7: Turn all alerts into buttons instead of browser alerts\
V8: Add countdown timer\
Pending: Add scoreboard, add background music, make it pretty with CSS.
